# Predictive-Analytics-on-Online-E-Sports-Ranking-
Feb. 2020–May 2020

In recent years, the Chinese society has been in a stage of rapid development.
People’s interest in online gaming has gradually intensified with the progress
and development of the society. In this context, the new industry of eSports
has emerged. E-sports was listed as a formal sports competition by the State
Sports General Administration in 2003 since when its development began to
accelerate. Although it experienced the low tide brought by the global financial
crisis, it quickly regained its upward momentum thanks to the support of a
large game user base.
Ranking is a widely-studied problem in eSport. Most of the competitions
involve numerous teams and many factors, making the gaming data more
complicated. Therefore, a fair and transparent ranking rule is particularly
important. We need to build a model that can overcome many uncertain
factors, so that the ranking results can accurately reflect the true strength of
the team.
